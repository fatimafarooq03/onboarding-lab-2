### Why do you think the reason for these different testing approaches are? What are their advantages and disadvantages?

#### There are different testing approach to ensure that the optimal test is chosen for the recquired goal of a program. Having many different tests to choose from gives programs more flexibility to choose a specific test that meets the program's constraints such as budget, time, etc.

#### The exhaustive testing approach would ensure that you program is 100% correct and does not fail for any given input, but it would require more computational power and more time to execute. 

#### Sampling for a specific number of cycles ensures that less computational power is used and the test requires less time to complete but does not test for all possible input combinations.

#### Random teesting can test for specific edge cases that the programmer did not think of, however it would be difficult to produce the specifc test failure again as the testing is random.
